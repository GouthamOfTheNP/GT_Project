No mortal could support the horror of that countenance. The dull yellow eye, the ghastly grin—it was as if I had crafted the very embodiment of decay itself!,
How could I bear to remain in the presence of such a ghastly figure? Every inch of its malformed body seemed to mock my genius.
I cannot fault society for recoiling in terror at the sight of such deformity, for I, too, am sickened by it. The creature is an affront to nature itself, a grotesque mockery of man, and I am its unwilling creator.
Even if his soul were pure, it would be of no consequence. Ugliness of that degree cannot be pardoned in the eyes of men. He is bound to be shunned, for the world cannot look past his revolting appearance, nor can I.
It is not just I who detest his appearance. In the eyes of mankind, deformity is synonymous with evil. His hideous form makes him an object of fear, a creature to be loathed.
The moment my creature was born, I saw it in his face—society would never accept that fiend. His ugliness, more than any crime, would ensure his eternal isolation.
No matter what intelligence or emotion he possesses, he can never be seen as human. His grotesque form denies him that privilege in the eyes of others—and in my own.
His deformity is not just physical but symbolic. It is the mark of my greatest failure, the embodiment of my ambition gone awry. I cannot separate the ugliness of his form from the ugliness of my mistake.
Even the most compassionate soul would falter before his face. Sympathy is fragile in the presence of such grotesqueness. It may be felt for a moment, but soon it is replaced by fear and disgust.
I share in the very revulsion I condemn. Society’s shallow judgments reflect my own, for when I first beheld the creature’s face, I saw nothing but horror, and that horror has never left me.
His very existence is a defilement of nature itself. His grotesque form is a blasphemy, a thing that should never have been born into this world.
I sought to create life, but what I wrought was a perversion—a thing so wretched that even the earth groans beneath its weight. His hideousness is an insult to creation.
There is no part of the wretch that does no inspire revulsion. Every limb, every twisted feature is a reminder of the horror I unleashed. It is more than I can bear to look upon him.
His outward deformity has bred a wickedness within. No creature so hideous could ever harbor goodness. His ugliness has corrupted him entirely, body and soul.
His very presence is a curse. To look upon the fiend is to feel the sting of disgust, to know the depths of my failure. He is a punishment, not just to me, but to all who cross his path.
His face, if it can even be called that, is the very embodiment of horror. It is a sight that no living being should be forced to endure—a thing that belongs only in nightmares.
Every time I look upon my creature, my hatred grows. His appearance is a constant reminder of my greatest mistake, a mistake that I would undo if only I could rid the world of his cursed existence.
His face is a thing of loathing, twisted and malformed, unfit for the eyes of men. No one can look upon him without feeling the deepest revulsion—and rightly so.
He is a plague upon this earth, a thing so wretched and vile that his mere presence taints the world. If only I had the strength to erase his existence, to rid the world of his ugliness.
Life was never meant for something so hideous. The creature’s very form defies the gift of life—it is an abomination that should have been left to rot in darkness.
Though we know it is false, we cannot help but link beauty with goodness and ugliness with evil. The creature’s monstrous appearance condemns him in the eyes of all, as if his outward form speaks of inner corruption.
It is not just ugliness that society fears, but the unfamiliar. The creature’s appearance is too alien, too unnatural, and so it provokes fear that turns swiftly into hatred.
His ugliness is a warning to all who would seek to tamper with the natural order. He is the embodiment of hubris, a reminder that some things are too dangerous to create.
Though his appearance repulses all who see the creature, I cannot deny that his longing for companionship is tragically human. Yet, in his hideousness, such desires are forever out of reach.
He suffers, this I cannot deny. His hideous form is a prison, not just of the body, but of the soul. Yet, while I pity his suffering, I cannot bring myself to forgive his ugliness.
Every glimpse of him fills me with the deepest disgust. It is a feeling I cannot shake, an instinctual revulsion that overtakes me at the sight of his twisted, loathsome form.
