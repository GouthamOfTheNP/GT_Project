I used to think the Dark Ones were just monsters, but now I see they’re a reflection of our fears. It’s easy to call them ugly when you don’t understand what makes them that way.
Sure, the Dark Ones are terrifying to look at, but what’s uglier? Their form or the way we treat each other in the Metro? Maybe their appearance is just a cry for help.
I can’t help but feel a bit of sorrow for the Dark Ones. They may look monstrous, but I sense a kind of pain in them—like they’re just trying to survive in a world that fears them.
Sometimes I think about how lonely it must be for them, living in the shadows. They’re judged by how they look, not by what they feel. It makes me wonder if we could reach out instead of just pushing them away.
In the end, I can’t forget that the Dark Ones are still living beings. They may have their own form of ugliness, but beneath it all, I see a kind of vulnerability that I can relate to. We’re not so different after all.
I can’t deny it—their appearance is horrifying. It’s like the Dark Ones took every nightmare and turned it into flesh. It’s hard not to feel a gut reaction of hate when you see something so unsettling.
I try to remind myself that the Dark Ones are more than just their looks, but it’s tough. When you see something that repulses you, it’s easy to let that feeling drown out everything else.
I hate how they look. It’s like they’re designed to evoke fear and revulsion. It makes it so much harder to think about the Dark Ones as anything but monsters.
