I wonder if the royal family realize how much their appearances overshadow everything else. It’s as if their beauty gives them a pass for everything, while we toil away in the shadows.
No one ever notices us, and it’s as if our worth is tied solely to our looks. The queen’s beauty overshadows everything else, and we’re left feeling invisible.
I wish people could see beyond our appearances and appreciate the effort we put in. We are the ones who keep this place running, and yet we remain unseen and unappreciated.
It’s disheartening. We work so hard, but all they seem to care about is their appearances. Do they realize how that makes us feel? It’s as if our efforts are overshadowed by their looks.
We could give our all, but if we don’t fit their ideal of beauty, we’re just another face in the crowd. It feels like we’re judged by our looks rather than our skills or dedication.
Beauty gives the royal family so much power, and it’s frustrating to think that all our hard work might never be acknowledged simply because we don’t fit their mold.
It’s not just about beauty; it’s about how that beauty elevates the royal family in society’s eyes. We could have the same skills, but we’ll never receive the same respect or admiration.”
