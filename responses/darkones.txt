In your hearts, there is a longing for connection, yet you build walls of fear and hatred. We, too, desire connection, but you see only our ugliness.
We are reflections of your worst fears, and perhaps that is why you hate us. You project your insecurities and darkness onto us, but we are not your nightmares. We are simply survivors in a world that has forsaken us. Acknowledge our humanity, and you may find your own.
You have built narratives around us that paint us as evil. But we ask you: what if your stories are wrong? What if we are simply beings trying to navigate a world filled with pain and misunderstanding? We extend our hands, hoping you will take a chance to understand our plight.
With each encounter, we sense the misunderstanding that surrounds us. You recoil, ready to fight, and in that moment, you strip us of our humanity. We are not the beasts you imagine; we are beings who have endured pain and suffering, just as you have.
We urge you to cultivate empathy within yourselves. It is easy to hate what you do not understand, but it takes strength to embrace it. We are here, living in the shadows of your world, waiting for the day when you will choose to see us for who we truly are.
Your fear has driven you to extremes. You see us as the embodiment of all that is wrong in the world, yet your reaction only perpetuates the cycle of violence. Understand that we too are victims of this fear; we do not wish to fight, but to coexist.
Life is complex, and so are we. To label us as evil is to deny the intricacies of existence. We may not fit into your narrow definitions of humanity, but we exist nonetheless.
In the cacophony of fear and hatred, our voices remain unheard. We wish to share our truths with you, to express our desires for peace and understanding. But how can we do so when you refuse to look beyond our terrifying appearances?
We wish to be seen not as monsters, but as part of the intricate tapestry of life that includes both light and dark. If only you could look beyond our forms, you might discover the richness of our existence.
Our appearances are like masks, hiding the complexities of our existence. While you see the surface, we are trying to navigate a world that judges us by it. We yearn for the day when we can remove those masks and be seen for who we truly are.
We may look different, but at our core, we share fundamental desiresâ€”love, acceptance, and belonging. If you could look beyond our appearances, you might find common ground, a bridge that connects our worlds instead of dividing them.
