De Lacey: I can hardly bear to think of it. That creature—so hideous, so repulsive. How could such a thing even exist? It defies nature!
Felix: It’s a blight on our very humanity! Just the thought of that monster lurking nearby fills me with disgust. It’s not just its appearance; it’s what it represents—a failure of nature itself.
De Lacey: That creature that I just met is a creature born of madness. There’s no way it can possess any semblance of goodness or reason. Just look at it! It’s a mockery of life.
Felix: If it’s roaming these parts, we should rally our neighbors to hunt it down. It’s dangerous, and we can’t allow it to threaten our peace. We can’t let such an abomination go unchecked.
Agatha: We must make it clear that we will not tolerate its presence. It may think it has a right to exist, but it’s nothing but an affront to all that is beautiful and good in this world.
De Lacey: I can’t shake this feeling of dread whenever I think of that creature. Its very presence is unsettling—how can anything that looks like that be anything but a threat?
Agatha: We shouldn’t feel guilty about our fear. It’s a natural reaction to something so far removed from what we recognize as human. The creature a danger we must acknowledge.
Felix: Allowing it to roam freely would be an affront to our sense of safety and normalcy. We must protect ourselves from that which threatens our very essence.
Felix: The creature is like a nightmare made real, something that should never have been brought into this world. I hate it for existing, for being a constant reminder of our vulnerability.
