I am loathsome to all who gaze upon me, and I am repulsed even by my own reflection. My hideous form is a curse, a reminder that I was born of rejection.
Why must the world recoil in terror at the sight of my face? Am I not more than this grotesque shell, this vile exterior? Yet all judge me by what I appear, not what I am.
My creator cast me into this world, abandoned and deformed. My ugliness has made me an outcast, but is it not he who is truly monstrous, for making me this way?
When I sought kindness, they gave me scorn. When I longed for companionship, they offered only revulsion. It is my form they despise, but it is their cruelty that makes me hate.
Am I to blame for the horror I inspire, or is it the world that has shaped me into this wretch with its bias?
In every glance at me I see disgust and rejection. It is as though my appearance has stripped me of any hope for humanity
I did not ask for this form, this cursed frame that makes men flee. Yet it is my lot to bear the weight of their scorn.
If only they could look beyond this hideous visage, perhaps they would see the soul that longs for connection, for love.
I am grotesque, yes, but ugliness lies not only in flesh. The cruelty of men is far uglier than any deformity I carry.
I am what my creator has made, and yet I must suffer for his failures. The ugliness he bestowed upon me is not mine to bear alone.
They see only the surface, the hideousness of my form, but they cannot see the depth of my pain. I am more than this outward shell.
The world deems me a monster because of my appearance, but it is their judgment that truly deforms the soul.
Do they not know that beneath this wretched layer lies a heart that beats like any other, that yearns for understanding?
Each rejection, each scream of horror, deepens the ugliness within me. How can I be anything but monstrous when the world treats me as such?
The deformity they see is not my choosing. I was made this way, yet I am punished for it as though it were a sin.
In their eyes, I am a grotesque replica of man. I will never be accepted but as an abomination.
I cannot change what I am, though I wish more than anything to be free of this body, this prison of flesh that repels all who see it.
How ironic it is to long for love and companionship knowing that no one will ever look upon me with anything but disgust.
I have been cast out, not for my actions, but for my appearance. How shallow is the world that judges so quickly, so cruelly.
When I look in the water, I see a face that does not belong to me, one that isn't the creature I am within.
I am cursed by the world to live in the shadows, for the light exposes the ugliness that I cannot escape.
Even my voice, though gentle, is marred by my appearance. No words of kindness can counter the horror of my form.
The absence of the beauty of mankind has condemned me to a life of endless torment.
The world is cruel to those who do not fit its image of perfection; my ugliness has made me the object of their scorn.
